# Casting Agency Project
This is my final capstone project for Udacity's FullStack Web Developer Nanodegree.
Web app can be accessed at [here](https://)

## Project Motivation
The Casting Agency Project simulates a company focused on producing movies and managing actors by assigning them to different film projects. As an Executive Producer within the company, you are building a system to simplify and enhance the workflow for movie creation and actor assignments.

This project serves as a platform for practicing and showcasing a range of web development skills, including data modeling, API design, authentication and authorization, and cloud deployment.
